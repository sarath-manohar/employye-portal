Basic Commands
-------------------

- To Create Project : ng new projectname
- To run            : ng serve --open
- To Create Components : ng g c component name


Basic Concepts
-------------------

- Module - To hold Components
- components - Part UI (Combination of TS file ,HTML,CSS,Root Component,App component)
- To Setup Path - Define path in routing component
-Data Binding - Data share within a component
  One Way Data Binding 
    - ts (component) to html (view/template)
       -string interpolation {{class}}
       - property binding  [class property]
    - html (view) to ts(component) 
        event binding  = (click)
        event binding using  $event 
            event binding using template variable = #variable-name

  -Two Way Data Binding- using [(ngModel)] directive
     import formsModule to module file ,then use [(ngModel)]= "class property"
   - Angular directives : are classes that add additional behaviour to html elements
           - prebuilt directives 
                 - component directives :component selector used to display component template 
                  - ngModel directive :used to manage form control

              -structural directives : used to add or remove elements from angular application
                - *ngIf = "conditional rendering
                - *ngFor = manage list of items

    -Dependency injection : communicate between two components
               when two classes are dependent then one class can access others property and function,it should provide
               in constructor
               -syntax : access-specifier variable-name :dependent-class-name


      - handling asynchronus functions : rxjs library
        observable :
           -subscribe(callnback/observer object): resolve state
        -api call :use http methods in httpclient class
                   :import  httpclientModule to your module file
